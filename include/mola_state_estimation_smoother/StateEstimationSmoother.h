/** Sliding window Factor-graph data fusion for odometry, IMU, GNSS, and SE(3)
 * pose/twist estimations.
 *
 * Frame conventions:
 * - There is a frame of reference for each source of odometry, e.g.
 *   there may be one for LiDAR-odometry, another for visual-odometry, or
 *   wheels-based odometry, etc. Each such frame is referenced with a "frame
 *   name" (an arbitrary string).
 *
 * - Internally, this class uses the {utm}, {enu}, and {map} frames. Refer to
 *   the frame diagrams [here](https://docs.mola-slam.org/latest/mola_state_estimators.html).
 *
 * - The name for the reference frame (Default: `"map"`) and the robot/vehicle (`"base_link"`)
 *   can be changed from the parameters (e.g. the config yaml file).
 *
 * - This package DOES NOT follow the [ROS REP 105](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0105.html)
 *   specifications in the sense that `/tf` from `{map} → {odom}` are not published.
 *   Instead, it directly emits `{map} → {base_link}` from the fusion of all available data.
 *
 * - Publishing the vehicle pose in a timely manner uses "params.reference_frame_name" as
 *   reference frame.
 *
 * - IMU readings are, by definition, given in the local robot body frame, although
 *   they can have a relative transformation between the vehicle and sensor.
 *
 * Main API methods and frame conventions:
 * - `estimated_navstate()`: Output estimations can be requested in any of the
 *      existing frames of reference.
 * - `fuse_pose()`: Can be used to integrate information from any "odometry" or
 *     "localization" input, as mentioned above.
 * - `fuse_gnss()`: Integrate GNSS observations, to help with localization in geo-referenced maps,
 *     or to automatically find-out the geo-referencing of a map.
 * - `fuse_imu()`: Used to help with (1) global azimuth in geo-referenced maps, (2) vertical
 *     direction from accelerometer, (3) angular velocity from gyroscope.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - (1) Call initialize() to set the required parameters.
 * - (2) Integrate measurements with `fuse_*()` methods. Each CObservation
 *       class includes a `timestamp` field which is used to estimate the
 *       trajectory.
 * - (3) Repeat (2) as needed.
 * - (4) Read the estimation up to any nearby moment in time with
 *       estimated_navstate()
 *
 * Old observations are automatically removed.
 *
 * A constant SE(3) velocity model is internally used, without any
 * particular assumptions on the vehicle kinematics.
 *
 * For more theoretical descriptions, see:
 * https://docs.mola-slam.org/latest/mola_state_estimators.html
