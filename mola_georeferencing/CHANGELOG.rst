* Add guards against failures for missing input .mm files
* Merge pull request `#17 <https://github.com/MOLAorg/mola_state_estimation/issues/17>`_ from MOLAorg/feat/mm-add-geodetic-handle-null-geodetics

  Use IMU even without GPS data
* improved unit tests
* fix potential UB
* Use IMU even without GPS data
* IMU frames: use averaged gravity measurements per key-frame
* Merge pull request `#15 <https://github.com/MOLAorg/mola_state_estimation/issues/15>`_ from MOLAorg/fix/use-lvb
  georeferencing: correctly use IMU data in the LocalVelocityBuffer too…
* georeferencing: correctly use IMU data in the LocalVelocityBuffer too for gravity alignment
* Merge pull request `#14 <https://github.com/MOLAorg/mola_state_estimation/issues/14>`_ from MOLAorg/feature/use-imu-for-georef-hint
  Feature/use-imu-for-georef-hint
* Fix potential errors
* georeferencing now optionally uses IMU acceleration measurements to help with gravity-alignment

* Make mola_gtsam_factors non headers-only and rename GNSS2ENU as GnssEnu for consistency
* process CObservationRobotPose
* integrate code coverage in cmake
* package.xml: add FILE to license tags
* Refactor to expose all gtsam factors into a new library 'mola_gtsam_factors'
