/** Transforms IMU readings from an arbitrary sensor pose to the vehicle reference "base_link".
 *
 * This basically rotates the angular velocity vector according to `raw_imu.sensorPose` and
 * transforms the acceleration vector according to the lever between vehicle "base_link" and the
 * sensor pose.
 * The returned IMU reading object has `sensorPose` set to the SE(3) identity to reflect its new
 * frame.
 *
 * Note that bias is *not* substracted here, it must be done by the caller.
 *
 * Since this class has a state (the stamp of the last observation), one object must be instantiated
 * for each IMU sensor.
