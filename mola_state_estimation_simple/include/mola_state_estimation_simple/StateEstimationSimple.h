/** Simple motion-model state estimator fusing odometry, IMU, and SE(3) pose/twist.
 *
 * Usage:
 * - (1) Call initialize() or set the required parameters directly in params_.
 * - (2) Integrate measurements with `fuse_*()` methods. Each CObservation
 *       class includes a `timestamp` field which is used to estimate the
 *       trajectory.
 * - (3) Repeat (2) as needed.
 * - (4) Read the estimation up to any nearby moment in time with
 *       estimated_navstate()
 *
 * ## Prior covariance model (estimated_navstate)
 *
 * Given `dt` seconds elapsed since the last `fuse_pose()` call, the returned
 * prior pose covariance diagonal is:
 *
 *   cov_xyz = sigma_relative_pose_linear^2
 *           + (sigma_random_walk_acceleration_linear * dt)^2
 *
 *   cov_rot = sigma_relative_pose_angular^2
 *           + (sigma_random_walk_acceleration_angular * dt)^2
 *
 * `sigma_relative_pose_linear` [m] is a dt-independent floor on position
 * uncertainty and is the primary knob for tightening the ICP prior.
 * `sigma_random_walk_acceleration_linear` [m/s^2] adds time-growing
 * uncertainty due to unmodeled accelerations.
 *
 * \note This implementation of mola::NavStateFilter ignores the passed
 *       "frame_id" and GNSS observations.
