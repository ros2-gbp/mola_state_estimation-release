     *  It is what a DRIFTING source needs. An absolute-pose factor asserts that

     *  absolute pose in its own frame walks away steadily.

     *  In relative mode the covariance passed to fuse_pose() is read as the
     *  uncertainty of ONE INCREMENT, not of the absolute pose.

     *  0.05 m/s (0.25 m across a 5 s window, fifty times its declared
     *  per-increment sigma) the absolute formulation degrades by 2.3x while the
     *  relative one does not move at all -- but with no drift at all the
     *  absolute formulation is the better of the two, because N absolute poses
     *  carry more information than N increments. Use this for a source that
     *  really does drift; leave it off otherwise.
