/**
 * @file   test-odometry-long-drift.cpp
 * @brief  Wheel odometry that dead-reckons hundreds of metres away must not drag
 *         the fused trajectory with it.
 * @author Jose Luis Blanco Claraco
 * @date   Aug 21, 2026
 *
 * Wheel odometry is fused as relative increments between keyframes plus one
 * anchor factor resolving T_map_to_odom_i. With 600 m of true travel, a 4% scale
 * error and periodic 4x slip bursts, an accurate pose source must still keep the
 * fused trajectory near the truth: unbounded dead-reckoning drift, smooth or
 * bursty, must not leak into it.
